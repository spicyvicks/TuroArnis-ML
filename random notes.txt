•	To develop a system that can recognize individuals and analyze their body movements, achieving accuracy in understanding their posture and positioning.
•	To build a smart "TuroAnis" model that can correctly identify fundamental Arnis strikes and blocks with accuracy.
•	To demonstrate that beginners who use TuroArnis with its live feedback feature show a clear improvement in their Arnis stances when compared to learning without the app's guidance.




Known Issue: Hardcoded Template Reference in Hybrid Feature Inference

During live inference, the hybrid feature vector (30 values) fed into the GCN model is computed by comparing the user's pose geometry against the crown_thrust_correct expert template — regardless of what pose is actually being performed. This is caused by a hardcoded CLASS_NAMES[0] in 
app/computer_vision/gcn_inference.py
 (line 115), which was left as a placeholder. During training, each sample's hybrid features were correctly computed against its own class template (e.g., a Leg Block image was compared to the Leg Block template), producing high similarity scores for correct poses. At inference time, this mismatch means all non-Crown-Thrust poses receive artificially low similarity scores, which conflicts with what the model learned during training and likely reduces classification confidence for those classes. To fix: either retrain the model using raw geometric features (angles, distances) instead of Gaussian similarity scores in the hybrid feature vector — removing the template dependency entirely — or restructure inference to run all 12 templates and select the best-matching one before passing to the model.
