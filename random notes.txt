•	To develop a system that can recognize individuals and analyze their body movements, achieving accuracy in understanding their posture and positioning.
•	To build a smart "TuroAnis" model that can correctly identify fundamental Arnis strikes and blocks with accuracy.
•	To demonstrate that beginners who use TuroArnis with its live feedback feature show a clear improvement in their Arnis stances when compared to learning without the app's guidance.
